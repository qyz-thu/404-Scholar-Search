# 404-Scholar-Search
This is the front end of the team project in SOA
  
We use Vue CLI to set up local host.  
To start, use following instructions:  

    cd search
    npm run dev

If you haven't installed Vue CLI, first install node.js, then use following instructions to install:  

    npm install -g @vue/cli  

Our current frontpage should look like this:  
<img alt="snapshot of home page" src="./Homepage.png">  

Our result page should look like this:
<img alt="snapshot of result page" src="./result_page.jpg">

Our detail page should look like this:  
<img alt="snapshot of result page" src="./detail_page.jpg">

  
**Note**: Current version uses http api provided by backend on local host. Please refer to https://github.com/SigmaTsing/404-backend/tree/develop for details.
